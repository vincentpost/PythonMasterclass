    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code that performs a specific taks and is only executed when it is called from somewhere else inside your program. You typically create functions when certain tasks have to be executed several times. So as a general rule, when you're programming and you find that you are repeating the same lines of code twice or more, then it is time to think about bundling them into a function. This leaves less room for errors and it makes your code much easier to read and understand. Moreover, it is less work to change the function than it is to change the code in all the places where repetition occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code block below demonstrates how a function is defined. The first line starts with `def`, which tells Python that you plan to define a function. After `def` comes the name of the function, `describe_person` in this case. After the function name come parentheses. In this example, the word `name` appears between parentheses, meaning that the function `describe_person` accepts an *argument*, which in this case is called `name`. Effectively, `name` is a variable that will be available inside (and only inside) the function. Note that the line with the function definition must end with a colon, and that all code that belongs to the function must be indented."

Why would it do that, since it is clearly wrong?! The answer has to do with variable types. In this case we passed 10, which is an integer. The number got converted to an array with NumPy's `atleast_1d` function, from which the array with the return values was derived using the `empty_like` function. Because the function's input argument `x` was an integer, both arrays end up being integer arrays and the numbers they contain will remain integers, even when you assign a float to an element.\n",

    "Obviously that didn't work. If this were a real function that was being used inside a `for` loop for example, the program would crash. As a programmer you have to think of ways to prevent such things from happening. One way would be to embed the code inside the function between `try` and `except` statements. The code under `try` gets executed but when an error occurs, Python jumps to the `except` part where you can specify what needs to happen in that case. In this example, it probably makes most sense to issue some sort of warning and return an empty return value, which is available in Python as `None'"
